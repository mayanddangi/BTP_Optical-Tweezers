# Design and characterization of arrays of optical tweezers for single atom trapping
In this project, we are attempting to design optical tweezers capable of capturing a single neutral atom for use in quantum computing. In order to accomplish this goal, a liquid-crystal spatial light modulator is utilised, and a required phase is retrieved using the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm. We have developed the optical setup and demonstrated the optical tweezers for capturing and transporting the atoms. The next move is to do modification for flicker free movement of optical tweezers.
