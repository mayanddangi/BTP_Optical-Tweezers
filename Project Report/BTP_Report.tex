\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% We have demonstrated the generation of optical tweezers using the spatial light modulator.We are able to generate any 2D geometry using this method. The Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm is used to determine the optimum phase pattern for a specific trap configuration. We have determined the profile of each trap and it is found to have gaussian like structure. The need and approach to get defect-free array is discussed. We also demonstrated the movement of optical tweezers to transport the reservoir atom to vacancies.


We have demonstrated the generation of optical tweezers from arbitrary 2D geometry using the spatial light modulator scheme. The Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm is used to determine the optimal phase pattern for a specific trap configuration. We have determined the profile of each trap, and it is found to have a Gaussian-like structure. We have designed our system of trapping ~2N atoms for the requirement of N atoms in order to have a high probability of trapping N atoms, and neighbouring reservoir atoms will fill the vacant sites in the trapped array. We have obtained the optimal matching between the reservoir and vacancies using a Hungarian algorithm and experimentally demonstrated the optimal way of moving optical tweezers to transport the atom.

\section{Future scope}
\label{sec:scope}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The next objective is to modify the GS algorithm to eliminate flickering in the movement of atoms using real-time feedback from the imaging camera to reduce the number of atoms destroyed during the transit process. Afterwards, we will set up the optics in accordance with the presented design and characterize the complete systems for trapping caesium atoms. In the meanwhile, work may also be done to construct a laser with a wavelength of 976 nm and characterize it.
